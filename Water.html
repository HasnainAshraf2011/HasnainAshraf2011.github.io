<h2>What is water?</h2>
<p>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and nearly colorless
chemical substance.<br>It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent. is
vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients.</p>
<h2>The three states of water</h2>
<p>Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas.
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice,
its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or 
water vapor.</p>
<h2>Economical importance</h2>
<p>Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the fresh water used by humans goes to agriculture.Fishing
in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of
global protein.Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes.</p>
<h2>Density</h2>
<p>Water is one of only a few common naturally occurring substances which, for some temperature ranges, become less dense as they cool, and
the only known naturally occurring substance which does so while liquid. In addition it is unusual as it becomes significantly less dense
as it freezes, though it is not unique in that respect.<br>At 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of 999.972 kg/m3 (62.4262 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F).</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration
or distillation, or by a range of other methods. More than 660 million people do not have access to safe drinking water.</p>
